            <h2>Brand rationale</h2>
            <p>Our brand vision needs to simplify and refine how we talk as the SEEK organisation in a way that strengthens cohesion, but makes it flexible to use when delivering different services, in different channels, and talking to different audiences. The core guiding principles that SEEK believes in â€“ what we stand for. They are not necessarily unique and they rarely, if ever, change. They are discovered, rather than created. They are in our DNA. The brand vision is articulated as: An audacious, measurable and emotionally compelling goal for SEEK to focus on to inspire and galvanise our people.</p>

            <h2>Brand image</h2>
            <p>The SEEK identity is made up of a word symbol and word-mark. The main identity signature is the most important element of the SEEK identity system. It is specifically designed to create a balanced configuration between the word-mark and symbol. It is important to apply this signature properly and consistently across all corporate media. This will help to maintain a unified brand image.</p>

            <h2>Brand voice</h2>
            <p>The brand voice is best described as the way you sound and present across the many media platforms. A well managed brand voice attempts to remain consistent and authentic, as if spoken by an particular individual (who you hopefully like and/or respect). SEEK's brand has a unique voice which it uses to communicate clearly so that our audience recognise us, and better understand who we are and what we stand for. The style of our voice is 'conversational'. A conversation is a more relaxed, informal way of communicating. And while our tone always remains consistent â€“ the messages for each of specific audiences will be different.</p>

            <h2>Cobranding</h2>
            <p>The SEEK organisation has become quite a large global family, and our brothers and sisters in other countries are encouraged to manage their own unique brand voice. In Australia and New Zealand our family of companies include interests in employment, education, commercial acquisitions and volunteering opportunities. in each case the look and tone are intended to relate to one another, so that we present as a unified and coherent organisation. It is important therefore, that many of the same rules that apply to seek.com.au apply to each of the others, too. Each of the brand marks present consistently, as seen in Figure 6, but each also has its own colour to identify it by, and to differentiate itself from the employment brand. Brandmarks present consistently, as seen in Figure X, but each also has its own colour to identify it by, and to differentiate itself from the employment brand.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>The exemplification of a working user experience for the various SEEK touch-points is the care that is taken to ensure that all interactions consider all users that come to the site. Because SEEK have an incredibly broad user demographic, care must be taken to ensure that each and every user is able to use the SEEK products to improve their chances of employment. This is where 'inclusive design' is most important for the user experience. It never focuses on simply the disabled user, but instead understands that well crafted solutions can be of benefit to all users.</p>

            <h2>Cross channel experience</h2>
            <p>In the rich digital eco-system that SEEK's suite of products exist in there is a heavy reliance on each devise not only looking like each other, knowing what the other doing but also providing the optimum user experience that each has to offer. We understand that some of our audience jumps from one platform (devise operating environment) to the other and back again, particularly if they are actively search for jobs. For this reason it is vital that the experience that we provide in one environment is best reflected in other environments, recognising that each solution leverages the strengths and weakens of that environment.</p>
